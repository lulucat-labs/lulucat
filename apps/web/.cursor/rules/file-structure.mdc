# LuluCat Web File Structure

## Key Files and Directories
- [src/app.tsx](mdc:src/app.tsx) - Main application entry point
- [src/access.ts](mdc:src/access.ts) - Access control configuration
- [config/config.ts](mdc:config/config.ts) - Application configuration
- [config/routes.ts](mdc:config/routes.ts) - Route definitions

## Component Organization
- [src/components/](mdc:src/components/) - Reusable components used across multiple pages
  - Each component typically has its own directory with an index.tsx file

## Page Structure
- [src/pages/](mdc:src/pages/) - Page components organized by feature/route
  - Each page typically has:
    - index.tsx - Main page component
    - components/ - Page-specific components
    - data.d.ts - TypeScript type definitions for the page
    - hooks/ - Custom hooks related to the page

## Services
- [src/services/](mdc:src/services/) - API service functions organized by domain
  - Each service file corresponds to a backend API domain

## Internationalization
- [src/locales/](mdc:src/locales/) - Internationalization files
  - Organized by language code (e.g., en-US, zh-CN)
  - Further organized by feature (menu, pages, settings, etc.)
